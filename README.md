#  Language Detection with Machine Learning

##  Overview
As a human, you can easily detect the languages you know. For example, I can easily identify Hindi and English, but being an Pakistani, it is also not possible for me to identify all Pakistani languages. This is where the language identification task can be used. Google Translate is one of the most popular language translators in the world which is used by so many people around the world. It also includes a machine learning model to detect languages that you can use if you don’t know which language you want to translate.

The most important part of training a language detection model is data. The more data you have about every language, the more accurate your model will perform in real-time. 

The dataset that I am using is collected from Kaggle, which contains data about 22 popular languages and contains 1000 sentences in each of the languages, so it will be an appropriate dataset for training a language detection model with machine learning. So in the section below, I will take you through how you can train a language detection model with machine learning using Python.

This project presents a **Machine Learning** approach to language detection through text classification. The Jupyter Notebook walks through the process of identifying the language of given text samples using traditional ML techniques.

##  Project Structure
- `language detection.ipynb` → Main notebook demonstrating the end-to-end workflow  
- `data/` → Directory for datasets (to be added by user)  
- `requirements.txt` → List of project dependencies (you can generate with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)

##  Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Swathi97054/Language-Detection-With-ML.git
    cd Language-Detection-With-ML/Language\ detection\ with\ ml
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (highly recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Linux / macOS
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Launch the notebook**:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

##  Dataset
You’ll need your own dataset, typically consisting of text samples labeled with their corresponding languages. You can use datasets from sources like Kaggle or the European Parliament Parallel Corpus.

The notebook walks through:
- Loading data files
- Preprocessing and cleaning text
- Creating labeled datasets for machine learning

---

##  Workflow & Methods
The notebook follows these key steps:

1. **Import necessary libraries**:  
   Common Python libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`.

2. **Data preprocessing**:  
   - Clean text (remove punctuation, lowercasing, normalization)  
   - Handle missing values and noise

3. **Feature extraction**:  
   - Convert text to numerical features via techniques like TF-IDF

4. **Model training and evaluation**:  
   - Split dataset into training and test sets  
   - Train classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree)  
   - Evaluate with metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix

5. **Model persistence** (optional):  
   - Save your trained model (e.g., using `pickle`) for future use without retraining

---

##  Results
- The notebook reports performance metrics for each model.
- It includes visualizations such as confusion matrices to interpret model performance.
- Summary of results: which classifier performed best in detecting language correctly.
